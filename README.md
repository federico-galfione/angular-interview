# Angular Interview

This project showcase a list of tests to solve based on Angular and Typescript.

## 1. Components Communication

Explain how to:
- Update the child component so it receives a message from the parent and displays it.
- Add a button to the child component that allows the user to update the message and show the list of updated messages in the parent component.
- Once you found a solution, do you know if there are other ways to share data between a parent and a child?

## 2. Form Validation
- Validate the form and show the error message only if the input is invalid.
- Explain if and how you would improve the solution to give better feedback to the user

## 3. Rxjs Subscription
- Show the list coming from the data$ subject in the template. `loadData` simulates a call to the server so cannot be changed.
- If I want to add a timestamp to show a timestamp for every element (the Date they are displayed for example), how could I do it?
- Is there more than a way to show the data in template coming from an Observable?

## 4. Bug fixing
- This code "compiles", but it presents a runtime error and doesn't show correctly the first name and email of the user. Fix the issues.
- Why the IDE didn't spot the problems?
- How can I improve the code to prevent these errors in the future?
